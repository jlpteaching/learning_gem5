**Welcome to the online Learning gem5 course!**

Below, you see a number of embedded [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos.
This course will be mostly videos with a little text/structure around them.

[Previously](http://learning.gem5.org/tutorial/index.html), *Learning gem5* was primarily a written document and in person tutorials.
However, after my experience Spring 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic teaching online, I decided that taking this material online would be a great way to reach a wider audience and to get more content out there.
(It's much faster to talk to a webcam than to write prose, at least for me.)

All of these videos will be available on the [gem5 YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCpCGEj_835WYmbB0g96lZw).
Subscribe to the channel to keep up to date as new videos are posted.
