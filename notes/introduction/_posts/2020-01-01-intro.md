## This is a test

## Hello!

- I am Jason Lowe-Power
  - Professor at UC Davis
  - gem5 PMC chair
- History with gem5
  - About 10 years
  - Built much of my thesis on it
  - Mostly memory system stuff
  - Also built gem5-gpu

## About this course

### Original plan

- Originally, I wanted to run an in-person summer school
- But, COVID-19 happened
- This is a good thing! Now, we can democratize this course

### Purpose

- What I wanted when I started with gem5
- Documentation for gem5

### The plan

- I'm going to post videos for each section ~1/week
- I'll be available for low latency communication each week
  - 1 hour on zoom
- We're definitely going to get through Using, modifying, cache coherence
  - Modifying and cache coherence have been covered previously
- Most likely going to get through CPUs as well
  - This has been mostly developed, but not written down.
- Using gem5 is going to be mostly new material focused on *using*---not developing---gem5
- I have included outlines for many other sections, we'll see if we get there this summer. We may have to do it next summer :)

### What this course is

- Each section will cover one topic in gem5
- There will be a discussion page on each topic in the discourse
- Each section will have some "assignments" to go with it
  - Most of these will be example use cases for gem5
- We won't be grading these assignments, but
